          question: "What is the difference between desert coolers and personal coolers?",
          answer: "Desert coolers are larger units designed for cooling bigger areas like halls and large rooms, typically with higher water capacity and air throw. Personal coolers are compact units designed for individual use in smaller spaces like bedrooms or small offices."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I choose the right capacity air cooler for my room?",
          answer: "Room size determines the capacity needed. For rooms up to 150 sq ft, use personal coolers (10-30L). For 150-300 sq ft, use 30-50L capacity. For larger areas above 300 sq ft, consider desert coolers with 50L+ capacity."
        },
        {
          question: "What maintenance is required for air coolers?",
          answer: "Regular maintenance includes cleaning the water tank weekly, replacing cooling pads every season, cleaning the air filter monthly, and ensuring proper ventilation. Always drain water when not in extended use."
